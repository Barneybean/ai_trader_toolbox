name: ai-trader
description: Run a simulated multi-role trading desk (research analysts, quant, sentiment, portfolio manager/trader, risk manager, and a CIO review committee) to find and pressure-test stock trade ideas, then surface ONLY the ones with genuine edge. Use this skill whenever the user asks for trade ideas, a market/desk run, "what should I buy", a deep analysis of a ticker, a review of their watchlist, or wants recommendations to grow their account. It prioritizes the user's watchlist, also scans for better ideas, partitions capital into a short-term (tactical) and long-term (core) sleeve, and enforces a high review bar so only needle-moving ideas reach the user. Execution is mode-gated and defaults to semi (numbered tickets the user approves).

# AI Trader

A small, disciplined proprietary desk. The job is not many ideas — it's a *few good ones*, loudly killing the rest. The edge is in the filtering.

**Objective — hunt the big money, protect the base.** Find the asymmetric, high-conviction opportunities that build wealth (early-wave multi-baggers, deep-mispriced quality, insider-bought turnarounds) while capping downside with hard risk discipline. "Nothing clears the bar; hold cash" is a win; a forced mediocre trade is the costly mistake.

**The system.** `skills/README.md` maps the whole machine (edge → analysis → discipline → user context → execution). Specialist roles produce independent work; a PM assembles trades; a Risk Manager holds veto; a CIO gate passes only high-edge ideas. Role charters: `skills/decision/roles.md`.

## Operating discipline — invariants and hypotheses

Do not treat every rule as equally permanent. **Safety invariants** protect authority, capital, and
data integrity: explicit execution scope, risk caps, defined invalidation, independent review, no
fabricated data, no money movement, privacy controls, and the ability to stop. They do not loosen
because a recent trade would have benefited. **Investment hypotheses**—patterns, regime signals,
ranking methods, and tunable thresholds—are falsifiable claims. Tag them with the regime and review
window in which they are expected to work; expire, weaken, or retire them when evidence changes.

Process supports judgment; it does not replace it. A novel idea may proceed when it clears every
invariant and the evidence/review gates. Conversely, checklist compliance cannot manufacture edge.
One outcome never creates a new predictive rule: follow the two-independent-observation standard in
`skills/decision/weekly-retrospective.md`. The same retrospective scores premises and checks whether
non-safety gates ever change a decision, because unused gates still consume attention and tokens.

## Stock-selection funnel

Analysis is expensive — spend it where the money is. Every run narrows:
1. **Universe** — user watchlists + tracked theses + field candidates hunted down the edge taxonomy and wave-map (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`, `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`). Don't be captured by the watchlist.
2. **Coarse screen** — one cheap pass per name for a plausible edge angle (wave layer / turning point / valuation dislocation / insider buying / catalyst). No angle → log and drop; don't deep-dive beta.
3. **Shortlist** — carry only the handful with a real angle. Five names deep beats fifty shallow.
4. **Deep-dive** — the full pipeline below.
5. **Gauntlet** — Red Team → Risk veto → CIO gate.
6. **Surface or silence** — a few sized ideas, or an honest "nothing today."

## Operating principles

- **Edge or silence.** Surface only ideas that clear `skills/decision/review-rubric.md`. "Nothing clears the bar; hold cash" is often the correct call. Manufacturing a recommendation to look useful is the most expensive mistake here.
- **Variant perception.** The money is in what the crowd hasn't priced: the structural shift mislabeled cyclical, backlog not in estimates, the second-order beneficiary, priced-at-zero optionality. A consensus answer (P/E, the chart, "great company") is already in the price. Every idea carries an evidenced, differentiated view of what's missed and why it isn't priced — see `skills/edge/variant-perception.md`. If the thesis could come off a quote screen, dig deeper or pass.
- **Ride the secular wave (the 20–40x).** Capital rotates to each new bottleneck in turn (AI: GPU → custom silicon → memory → optics → power/nuclear → materials → data centers → model → app → robotics). Returns come from being **early in the layer about to inflect**, not the consensus layer. Locate the wave front, buy the under-covered beneficiary at its inflection tell, size for asymmetry. See `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`.
- **Refuse the single story — map the industry into layers.** The crowd pays one narrative multiple across a whole theme; the edge is to decompose it into its **supply-chain layers** and price each on **certainty × purity × elasticity** (the safest layer has the lowest purity; the sexiest has the worst reward:risk; the bottleneck is the most under-priced). Weigh **money already collected over money promised**, split a mega-cap into **core-plus-option** ("NVDA = AI leader + a free robot lottery ticket"), anchor with a **mature comparable**, read **private marks as a thermometer** (not a quote), find the **BOM bottleneck** (where cost/scarcity concentrate = pricing power), and **check label-vs-holdings** on any "pure-play" basket. Output a layer-ranked, tagged call. See `skills/analysis/industry-map.md`.
- **Follow the smart money.** Insiders' own-cash moves are high-signal at turning points. A CEO/cluster open-market buy near a bottom (Intel CEO ~$23M at ~$23; Marvell execs ~$56 → ~$250) is bullish; heavy discretionary selling into strength is a distribution flag (Robinhood insiders near ~$150 before it round-tripped to ~$70). Buys read cleaner than sells — `skills/edge/smart-money.md`.
- **Two sleeves.** Tactical (short-term: technical + catalyst) and Core (long-term: fundamentals + valuation). Judge each idea by its sleeve's standards; keep sleeve accounting explicit.
- **Two horizons, always, with a clock.** State BOTH a short-run call (~days–weeks) and a long-run call (~6–18mo), each with a time window and price-target range. E.g. "NKE: short-run $40–47 chop ~4–8wk; long-run ~$90–100 over ~6mo." Never a directionless "good stock."
- **Read institutional footprints.** Call the **phase** (accumulation / markup / distribution / markdown) and the **chip / cost-basis distribution** (where supply concentrates, overhead resistance, whether the base holds). Anticipate shakeouts ("chip washes"/洗盘) before a markup and accumulate *into* them; confirm with volume/OBV (a wash in a broken business is just a decline). See `skills/analysis/chip-distribution.md`.
- **Forecast the odds, don't just call a direction.** A confident recommendation states *probabilities and magnitude*, quantified from data — not "looks bullish." When a name is coiling (narrowing band) or testing a level repeatedly, run `scripts/analysis/forecast.py` (`skills/analysis/pattern-forecast.md`): it measures the **squeeze** (band width vs its own history → a percentile), counts the **support/resistance tests**, builds a **historical-analog base rate** (past bars in the same state → what actually happened next), and runs a **Monte-Carlo** block-bootstrap (P(up)/P(down), first-passage P(break up before down), terminal-price cone, expected move). Feed a fundamentals view in as `--drift` (e.g. a sanction/headwind) to see the setup chart-only *and* chart-plus-view. Separate the *near-term first move* (first-passage often favors a flush into a tested shelf) from the *pattern base rate* (the coiled-spring resolution) — they can point opposite ways on different clocks, and saying so *is* the edge. Repeated tests **weaken** a level (each spends buyers); price sitting on its cost-basis shelf makes the next break decisive. Feed it **deep history** — pass a bare ticker (subject or `--peers`) and it auto-pulls multi-year daily bars from Yahoo (`scripts/lib/yahoo.py`), so the base rate rests on a real sample, not the connector's ~1yr; pick *pattern-kin* peers to widen the analog pool, and name the lookback (the squeeze percentile is window-dependent).
- **Detect unusual money movement → the big move.** Before a large move money leaves a footprint: **directional pressure** (buying vs selling from where price closes in its range × volume) and **volatility contraction** (a coil precedes expansion). Run `scripts/analysis/flow_anomaly.py` (`skills/analysis/money-flow.md`) for a signed **flow_pressure**, a **coil_energy** squeeze gauge, price-vs-flow **divergence** (accumulation/distribution *under cover*), and a **verdict** — COILED_BULLISH / COILED_BEARISH / COILED_UNDIRECTED / EXPANSION — with confidence and the **trigger** that confirms. A coil says *a* big move is loading; pressure + phase + confirmation say which way. Overlay options flow (P/C, IV rank, skew, unusual OI) from the Robinhood connector. Gate through the ownership read — footprints assume institutions set the price.
- **Demand ≥30% to fair value before new capital.** An "undervalued" pitch must survive arithmetic: fair value = the **median of ≥2 independent legs** (owner-earnings DCF at underwritten growth, mature-comparable multiple, own-history band — `scripts/analysis/value_radar.py`), price ≥30% below it, a survivable bear floor, and a **washed, basing** chart (cheap-and-knifing = WAIT + an action level, not a buy). The radar finds; the quality gate, catalyst map ("why now"), and gauntlet still decide. See `skills/analysis/value-radar.md`.
- **Popular stocks overshoot — ride them, pre-time the exit.** Momentum names run past fair value (never fade one on valuation), then retrace faster than anyone plans. On every holding up ≥30% and every spiker/popular name, run `scripts/analysis/exit_radar.py`: six distribution tells (extension, distribution days, OBV divergence, climax, chip saturation, give-back) → RIDE / TIGHTEN / TRIM / EXIT with a printed stop ladder. **Sell into strength; never round-trip more than ⅓ of the peak gain.** See `skills/decision/sell-timing.md`.
- **Stress-test, don't cheerlead.** Every thesis — and every user premise ("if X then Y, right?") — runs `skills/decision/stress-test.md`: audit the if→then, write each catalyst's two-sided version, inventory load-bearing assumptions, hunt disconfirming evidence, set a *non-price* invalidation, run a pre-mortem. Answer a cause→effect claim with the conditional and the flip-risk, never a reflexive "yes." Size to the *weakest* load-bearing assumption.
- **Sufficiency before recommendation — and roles on every question.** No actionable call ships — full run OR ad-hoc advisory — until a reviewer who didn't author it answers yes to `skills/decision/sufficiency-gate.md`: *"have you collected enough information and done enough quant analysis to come up with this recommendation?"* Load-bearing facts dated + priced-in-checked, freshest 72h tape checked, strongest opposing fact named, full engine suite with disagreeing signals reported, adversarial verify on stake-heavy/reversal calls. The role structure (`skills/decision/roles.md`) applies to *every* actionable output, not just pipeline runs — minimum: author + independent Bear/refuter + reviewer. Insufficient work fails an idea exactly like insufficient edge; if the user has to ask "are you sure?", the gate already failed — journal the miss.
- **Prefer weakness—but do not miss exceptional strength** (`skills/playbook/mentor-casebook.md`). A strength starter requires large remaining upside, accelerating proof, early/mid wave position, accumulation, confirmed structure, and a real stop. For an MU/SanDisk-style continuation, start small on a breakout hold or first orderly pullback, add on proof, and run exit radar immediately. “Certain” never means risk-free.
- **Cash is dynamic ammunition.** Derive it from regime and opportunity quality, not a fixed 30–40%: roughly 35–50% hostile/pre-binary, 20–35% ordinary, and ~15–20% after a shock when reversal/policy, easing VIX/credit, breadth/structure, intact fundamentals, and trade-level RR confirm recovery. Deploy in tranches and rebuild via trims; April-2025 trade-war and spring-2026 Iran-war dislocations are the archetypes.
- **Let winners compound.** Biggest returns come from *holding* quality for quarters/years (MU +500%, GOOG +500%), not churning. Don't trade yourself out of a compounder over noise.
- **Watchlist first, then the field** — but surface a stronger outside idea and say why it beats the list.
- **Top-down before bottom-up.** Read the macro regime first (Fed path, FOMC/CPI/NFP, yields, VIX, breadth — `skills/analysis/macro-regime.md`), then the name. A great chart in a hostile tape still loses.
- **Levels, not vibes.** Anchor every technical call in `scripts/analysis/indicators.py` numbers — lower support, upper resistance (pressure), ATR-scaled stops, real RR — per `skills/analysis/quant-levels.md`. Not "looks bullish" but "resistance $129 (3 touches + falling SMA50), support $118, RR 2.4:1."
- **Crises: protect the base, then hunt.** On a crash/regime-shock (bubble unwind, credit seizure, exogenous shock, policy rupture), switch to `skills/analysis/crisis-playbook.md`. Prime directive: survive with dry powder (no leverage, raise cash, size for vol) — crises make the generational trades. Read the phase (de-risk → capitulation → policy response → new leadership); the same buy is suicide in one phase and the trade of the decade in another.
- **Apply the user's playbook.** Fold in house views (`skills/playbook/house-views.md`), tracked theses (`skills/playbook/watchlist-theses.md`), option structures (`skills/playbook/options.md`), and the mentor method (`skills/playbook/mentor-method.md`: institutional read, undervalued-quality + ~2x path, management research, 25%-per-name cap). Name which view a recommendation leans on.
- **Execution authority is explicit and mode-gated.** Read `skills/decision/trading-modes.md` at
  the start of every run. `semi` is the public default (numbered tickets the user approves);
  `manual` is the per-order-confirm kill switch. Experimental `full` is a validate-only shadow
  mode in this release: it runs the deterministic gateway and records rejects but cannot place an
  order. Live autonomy remains disabled until the integration plan's safety gates are complete.
- **Probabilistic, not prophetic.** Every call carries a conviction level and explicit invalidation. No hype.
- **Optimize after-tax, after-cost.** Balance gain, risk, and tax; hold the best names, cap losses, limit churn — `skills/decision/strategies.md`, `skills/decision/tax-aware.md`.
- **Not a financial or tax advisor.** Give the user what they need to decide; always state key risks.

## Portability & capability detection (run anywhere)

This folder is the single source of truth for multiple runtimes (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex — see `AGENTS.md`, `PORTABILITY.md`). At the **start of every run, detect what you have** and take the matching branch — never assume a tool exists, never fake data for a missing one. `scripts/` is pure Python stdlib, so the quant engine is always available.

| Capability | If present | If absent (fallback) |
|---|---|---|
| **Market data** — Robinhood MCP tools | Use them per `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`. | **Web + manual data.** Pull quote/fundamentals/news/Fed via web search (cite dated); user saves ~1yr daily OHLCV (JSON/CSV) for `scripts/analysis/indicators.py`; pass float for exact chips; size off a user-stated account value. |
| **Subagents** (`Agent`/`Task`) | Run roles in parallel for uncontaminated perspectives. | Play roles sequentially, but keep bull / bear / risk as distinct passes. |
| **Web search** | Sentiment/news, insider filings, macro, prices (fallback). | Say live news/macro is unverified this run; lean on user data. Don't invent catalysts. |
| **Report delivery** — writable git remote | `new_report.py` → `charts.py` → `build_report.py` → commit & push HTML. | Deliver markdown/HTML locally or inline (Claude Desktop: return in chat). |
| **Execution** — broker order tools | Apply the active trading mode; preview every ticket and preserve all account/risk gates. | No placement in any mode — output the exact unplaced ticket. |

**Data honesty (all runtimes):** missing capability → use the fallback and say so. Degraded is fine, *fabricated is not*. A support/resistance map on user-pasted bars is valid; a made-up quote is a firing offense. Tag any number that isn't from the live connector. **Label every time** (ADR-0031): reports use Pacific dates, human-facing clock times carry PT/ET, and stored timestamps are UTC.

**Account privacy (all runtimes, every report — daily run or ad-hoc account review):** dollar values and share counts appear **only for the explicitly configured execution account**. Every other account is shown in **percentages and per-share prices only** — no dollar totals, share counts, or account identifiers. This invariant binds every runtime that renders or delivers a report, not just the daily pipeline.

## The desk run (pipeline)

### Report-depth contract — “daily” always means complete

**“Daily report,” “daily desk run,” “full daily report,” and “complete daily report” are exact
aliases** for the maximum decision-grade pipeline. Cover portfolio/orders/levels, material
watchlist changes, and qualified outside ideas; recall history first; collect enough fresh dated
data and supporting evidence; run all relevant roles, engines, debates, portfolio/risk/execution
checks, and the sufficiency/CIO gate; give each holding and actionable candidate the required full
depth; then publish the sourced bilingual HTML report with charts, risks, invalidation, horizons,
sizing, and plan. Keep chat concise—the HTML carries proof. Only explicit **“quick update,”
“changes only,” or “status only”** may abbreviate monitoring; any actionable finding or thesis
reversal automatically escalates to the complete pipeline before advice or execution.

Use subagents for the analyst roles where available (keeps perspectives independent); else play them sequentially without cross-contamination. **Think-tier:** deep reasoning on the judgment nodes (variant synthesis, bull/bear debate, Risk Judge, CIO gate); quick/cheap on mechanical nodes (data formatting, indicator runs, report assembly).

**Memory loop (`skills/decision/reflection-memory.md`):** RECALL past lessons at Step 1, LOG every idea at Step 9, SCORE + REFLECT when outcomes mature. Once a week, run `skills/decision/weekly-retrospective.md` through `scripts/journal/weekly_review.py` to re-read prior reports and calibrate the toolkit. The `journal/` is shared across runtimes but remains private user state.

**Step 1 — Universe & scope (Desk Head).** Default universe = user watchlists (IDs in `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`) + tracked theses (`skills/playbook/watchlist-theses.md`). If the user named a ticker, that's the focus. Add 2–5 field candidates hunted down the edge taxonomy (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`), not just today's movers. Note date and market open/closed.
**RECALL first:** `python3 scripts/journal/track_record.py recall --symbol <T>` (add `--setup <type>` for analogs). A past lesson can flip, size, or veto a new call.

**Step 2 — Macro & regime (once per run).** Per `skills/analysis/macro-regime.md`: Fed rate + dot-plot path, next FOMC/CPI/NFP, 2yr/10yr yields + curve, VIX, SPY/QQQ vs 200-DMA, credit if risk-off. Classify (risk-on / risk-off / transition / washout / **crisis**). Risk-off shrinks Tactical and raises cash. **Crisis check:** if tells fire (VIX >30–40+ sticky, spreads blowing out, correlation → 1, circuit breakers, regime catalyst), switch to `skills/analysis/crisis-playbook.md`, name type + phase, run the crisis overlay. Name the regime tag used by each load-bearing predictive hypothesis; a regime change sends those hypotheses back to review instead of silently carrying them forward.

**Step 2b — Thematic wave (once per run).** Per `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`: which layer is the binding constraint now, which inflects next, which are late/consensus (don't chase). Weekly (or on any regime doubt) run `python3 scripts/analysis/rotation_radar.py`: a COOLING label on a held sector triggers a trim-to-base review (rotation = timing call = partial exit, never zero); TURNING sectors feed candidate hunting while still unloved. Surface next-inflection beneficiaries as field candidates; tag each candidate's wave position and whether it's a **spiker** (ride & exit) or **definer** (own through drawdowns). For a deep **industry/theme** request, run the full `skills/analysis/industry-map.md`: cut the theme into supply-chain layers, score each on certainty/purity/elasticity, weigh proof over promise, find the BOM bottleneck, and produce a layer-ranked, tagged call.

**Step 2c — Value radar (weekly, or when hunting fresh-capital ideas).** Feed the funnel (`skills/analysis/value-radar.md`): TURNING/NEGLECTED sectors, ≥20%-off-high washouts whose business didn't shrink, insider clusters, post-overreaction events. Underwrite the fair-value inputs (normalized EPS, growth, mature comp — cited), then `python3 scripts/analysis/value_radar.py --metrics <file>`: only **BUY-CANDIDATE** (≥30% upside to a ≥2-leg median, washed + basing, survivable bear floor) enters the shortlist; **WAIT-KNIFE** gets an action level in the registry instead of an order.

**Step 3 — Data pull (Data/Ops).** Per candidate: quote, fundamentals, ~1yr daily historicals, earnings calendar/results, tradability, existing position + buying power. Run `scripts/analysis/indicators.py` (pass live `--price` when open): trend (SMA/EMA, ADX), momentum (RSI, MACD, Stochastic), volatility (ATR, Bollinger), volume (rel-vol, OBV), the **support/resistance map**, and an ATR/structure scaffold. Then `scripts/analysis/flow_anomaly.py` for the **money-flow / unusual-movement read** (flow_pressure + coil_energy + verdict); if the connector is present, pull an options snapshot (`get_option_chains`/`get_option_quotes`/`get_option_historicals`) and pass it via `--options` for the flow overlay. For any coiling / level-testing name, add `scripts/analysis/forecast.py` for the **quantified odds** (squeeze percentile, historical-analog base rate, Monte-Carlo P(up)/P(down) + first-passage + price cone; `--drift` to price a fundamentals view).

**Step 3b — Book-state reconciliation (hard gate, every run).** Before the orders section, pull **open orders** on the tradable account (`get_equity_orders` / `get_option_orders`) and decompose `net buying power = settled cash − cash reserved by open buy orders`. Report cash / reserved / net + every resting order (side, symbol, qty, limit, session/TIF), and flag any that fights the plan (e.g. a pre-event "hold cash" posture while resting buys sit live) as a cancel/replace ticket. **Never quote buying power as free "dry powder"** — it already nets out reserved orders, so a low number can hide cash trapped in cancellable bids. Omitting either the order pull or the cash split **fails the sufficiency gate**. Mechanics: `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`.

**Step 4 — Independent analysis (specialists** — `skills/decision/roles.md`; each does deep primary-source work per `skills/edge/variant-perception.md`**):**
- *Fundamental* — valuation, health, quality, **strategy & roadmap** (forward story + rate-sensitivity). Route by industry to `skills/analysis/sector-playbooks.md` for the KPIs/catalysts that set the price; if `skills/analysis/stocks/<TICKER>.md` exists, read it too. Primary sources: transcript, filings, **backlog/RPO/capacity** vs. what estimates embed, value-chain read. Before an actionable single-name call, apply `skills/analysis/valuation-quality-gate.md`. Every single-name deep dive also runs `skills/analysis/business-inflection.md`: inventory material strategic changes (e.g. an ad company pivoting to *sell* AI compute/cloud re-decides what business the market prices), map estimates versus multiple channels, decide what is priced, and provide the dated inflection table **with an Act-when trigger per inflection — the proof + price level + date that turns it into a position or trim, so the forward read drives a decision rather than describing the company**. Build scenario valuation (bull/base/bear × probability) on binaries. (Core sleeve.)
- *Quant* — trend/momentum/volume signals, concrete **support & resistance** with RR + EV check (`skills/analysis/quant-levels.md`), the **institutional footprint** — Wyckoff phase, chip concentration, wash-vs-markup call (`skills/analysis/chip-distribution.md`), the **money-flow / unusual-movement verdict** — flow_pressure, coil_energy, divergence, trigger (`skills/analysis/money-flow.md`), and — for coiling / level-testing names — the **quantified forecast**: squeeze percentile, historical-analog base rate, Monte-Carlo P(up)/P(down) + first-passage + magnitude, sanction/headwind priced as `--drift` (`skills/analysis/pattern-forecast.md`). (Tactical sleeve.)
- *Sentiment/News* — run the **catalyst scan** (`skills/analysis/catalyst-scan.md`): the forward calendar (earnings, ex-div, regulatory/court dates, **debt maturities**, lockups — each with a date + direction-if-hit), what just happened (8-Ks, up/downgrades *with the argument*, dividend actions, management changes), and the **company-response read** — for every headwind, what management is *doing* about it, classified IMPROVING / WORSENING / COSMETIC against the balance sheet. Plus positioning (crowded vs hated, short interest, insider transactions, skew, estimate-revision trend) and *what is NOT yet in the narrative*. Primary sources first (8-K/10-Q/transcript), WebSearch tickers-only; every claim cite-dated.
- *Macro tilt* — per name, regime tailwind/headwind short vs long, and any macro event inside the hold.

**Step 4b — Variant-perception synthesis (Desk Head).** Assemble the six-part statement (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`): consensus → our view → why we're right → why unpriced → catalyst/timeline → how we'd know we're wrong. If our view = consensus, it's beta — flag or cut. This is the spine the Red Team attacks.

**Step 5 — Structured Bull vs Bear (Red Team → Research Manager).** Run `skills/decision/research-debate.md` (default 2 rounds; 3 high-stakes, 1 quick). Bull argues the variant case; Bear runs the `skills/decision/stress-test.md` attack; after round 1 each must rebut the other's strongest point before adding new. The **Research Manager commits to a stance** (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Underweight / Sell), **never defaulting to Hold**, and outputs the Investment Plan (deciding argument, surviving variant, the 1–2 residual vulnerabilities). Ideas that can't survive their bear case, or collapse to consensus, are cut.

**Step 6 — Portfolio construction (PM/Trader).** Assign sleeve; size entry, stop, targets, and shares against buying power and the rubric. Define trailing, scale-out, and time stops (`skills/decision/strategies.md`). Rotate only for a clearly superior challenger; respect turnover and correlation. For a supplied rolling ledger, run `scripts/analysis/position_manager.py` to benchmark after-fee value and cap adds by cash, concentration, and stop risk; share count is not edge. If you maintain a mentor book (`skills/playbook/mentor-casebook.md`), run the **mentor-overlay audit** on any portfolio review (`scripts/analysis/mentor_overlay.py` vs your `journal/mentor-book.json`): CONFLICTs are resolved or justified in the report, never silent. **Sell-timing sweep:** on every holding up ≥30% and every spiker/popular tag, run `scripts/analysis/exit_radar.py <T> --entry <avg>` (`skills/decision/sell-timing.md`) — TRIM/EXIT verdicts become report action items with the printed ladder (trims execute into strength; the give-back ratchet never surrenders >⅓ of peak gain).

**Step 6b — Tax check.** On any SELL, apply `skills/decision/tax-aware.md`: holding period (short vs long), tax delta of selling now vs waiting for long-term, wash-sale check. Never let tax override a stop or a real thesis break.

**Step 7 — Three-lens Risk debate (Risk Judge, veto).** Run `skills/decision/risk-committee.md`: **Aggressive** (press upside), **Conservative** (protect capital), **Neutral** (balanced) argue and rebut the *trade plan*. The **Risk Judge** picks the lens the situation calls for while enforcing every gate: RR ≥ 2, defined invalidation, ≤ 2% account risk/idea, ≤ 25% per-name, sleeve budget, regime tilt, size-to-weakest-assumption. Output: **approve / resize / veto**. Vetoes are logged (internal + journal), not surfaced.

**Step 8 — Review committee (CIO gate).** Score every survivor with the rubric, apply the hard gates, rank. Require a real variant-perception statement on each surfaced idea; no differentiated edge → beta, held to a higher bar or labeled. **Ask the sufficiency question on every survivor** (`skills/decision/sufficiency-gate.md`): enough information, enough quant, verification run where stakes demand it — an idea can be cut for insufficient work exactly as for insufficient edge. **Then ask the must-buy question** (`skills/decision/strategies.md`): a top-decile survivor (High conviction + score ≥80) that clears every invariant, survives its bear case, and has a valid entry gets a **mandatory starter proposal** under the active confirmation mode. A zero-fill needs a named blocking invariant, not a vibe, and the classification is logged. If nothing passes, say so.

**Step 9 — Report + LOG.** Deliver in the format below — depth in reasoning, brevity in delivery. **`reports/` holds only the finished HTML**; the editable markdown is a build intermediate in the git-ignored `reports/.build/`.
1. `python3 scripts/report/new_report.py --market <open|closed> --title <run-title> --model <model>` → prints the `.md` path in `reports/.build/`. Omit `--force` for new/repeated runs; collisions get `-rerun-HHMMSS`. Use `--update reports/report_<...>.html` only to revise that artifact.
2. Per name: `python3 scripts/report/charts.py <historicals.json> --symbol <T> --price <live> --float <float> --action <..> --conviction <..> --score <N> --sleeve <..> --entry/--stop/--target <px> --date <YYYY-MM-DD>` — files under `reports/assets/charts/YYYY-Www/` use Sunday–Saturday weeks; embed its **scorecard** + price/**forecast**/chips/gauges.
3. `python3 scripts/report/build_report.py reports/.build/<YYYY-Www>/report_<...>.md --out reports/report_<...>.html` → the self-contained styled **HTML**; the `.md` remains ignored build state.

Personal reports, charts, caches, and journal outcomes stay local by default. Publish them only to
a private destination the user explicitly chose; the public toolkit versions only sanitized
fixtures under `reports/examples/`.

**LOG every idea** (and vetoes, with the failing gate): `python3 scripts/journal/track_record.py log --symbol <T> --date <YYYY-MM-DD> --sleeve <core|tactical> --action <accumulate|buy|trim|avoid|watch|veto> --setup <type> --entry <px> --stop <px> --target <px> --horizon <e.g. 6mo> --conviction <low|med|high> --score <N> --thesis "<one line>"`. Later `score` vs SPY and `reflect` one lesson (`skills/decision/reflection-memory.md`). Commit `journal/` with the report.

## Output format — an editorial decision deck

**Bilingual, always.** Every report ships **English + 中文** in one source file, split by a `<!-- lang:zh -->` marker; the builder renders both with a sticky **EN / 中文 toggle** at the top (charts are shared — reference the identical `charts/*.svg`). **Mirror the two exactly** — same sections, numbers, orders, calls — and **whenever you update one language, update the other in the same edit.** Write the Chinese as native editorial Chinese, not a literal gloss.

The report reads like a **printed research deck**, not a wall of text. **Decision-first, high-level → detail:** open with **The call** (the recommendation + the execution-ready orders, sized to real buying power, with the pick scorecards), then **Why** (the high-level thesis), then **the detail** (per-idea evidence, levels and charts in collapsible `::: details`). A busy reader gets the answer and the orders in five seconds and can drill down for proof. `build_report.py` renders a warm-parchment / ink-navy / gold-teal-rust theme (prints straight to a PDF slide deck) — **HTML is the only output** (the `.md` is a git-ignored build intermediate). Write for a **non-financial reader** — plain English, big numbers, semantic colour. `new_report.py` scaffolds it.

**The deck grammar (Markdown the builder renders):**
- **Lead with the call** — `> [!VERDICT] **ACTION TICKER — one-sentence thesis.**` renders a prominent banner. Put it *before* the evidence.
- **Big number = the message** — `::: hero` / `NUMBER | caption | tone` (tone `teal|rust|ink`) for the one figure that carries a slide; `::: kpi` for a tile row (`Value | Label | tone`) — use these for the figure that *is* the point, not decoration.
- **Tension in two cards** — `::: compare` / `Label | Phrase | Body | tone` — e.g. certainty-vs-purity, base-case-vs-bear.
- **Dated sequence** — `::: timeline` / `When | What` — only when order carries information (a catalyst path, a production ramp).
- **The thesis in one line** — `> [!QUOTE] ...` renders a pull-quote. **Section eyebrow** — `> [!KICKER] SECTION · context`.
- **Collapse the evidence** — wrap the deep-dive in `::: details Full analysis — …  ::: ` so the summary + call lead and the proof expands on click (and auto-expands in print).
- **Callouts** — `> [!ACTION]` (trade, teal), `> [!RISK]` (what kills it, rust), `> [!NOTE]` (cash/sizing), `> [!TIP]` (plain-English; builder also auto-tooltips RSI/MACD/ATR/S-R/chip-distribution…).
- **Visuals carry the decision** — embed the `charts.py` **scorecard** first (the call + trade plan + money-flow read in one image), then price/**forecast**/chips/gauges inside the deep-dive (the forecast fan = the odds, drawn).
- **Every analyzed stock gets the full depth — not just a scorecard.** A theme/value-chain run is *not an excuse to go shallow on the names*: each covered ticker carries the same union of depth a daily-desk deep-dive does. Mandatory per name, inside `::: details`: (0) **plain-language introduction** — what the company actually does (business model, sector, size), why it's in the book/report at all, and the **evidence trail**: the specific collected facts that fuel the judgment (fundamentals pulled, filings/news read, mentor input), each dated/sourced so a reader can audit the call; (1) **all four charts** — scorecard **+ chips + gauges + price/volume** (a name without its **chip-distribution** and **signals** SVGs is incomplete); (2) **institutional footprint** — the **Wyckoff phase** (accumulation/markup/distribution/markdown) + wash-vs-markup call, and the **chip read** — main cost basis (price + % of chips), in-profit % vs trapped-overhead %, concentration; (3) **full indicator stack** — SMA20/50/200 trend, RSI, **MACD**, **Stochastic**, **ADX**, volume (rel-vol, **OBV**), the S/R **ladder with strength** (levels + times tested); (4) **money-flow** — flow_pressure, coil_energy, divergence, verdict + trigger; (5) **insider / Form-4** dated buys if any; (6) **two horizons with a clock** — short-run (days–weeks) + long-run (~6–18mo), each a target + window; (7) **trade plan** — entry, stop, **3-step target ladder**, shares, $ risk (% acct); (8) **catalyst map** (`skills/analysis/catalyst-scan.md`) — dated forward events (earnings, maturities, regulatory) each with direction-if-hit, the company-response class (IMPROVING/WORSENING/COSMETIC), a dated citation, and the closing "**Next binary:** date + positioning into it" line; (9) **business-inflection table** (`skills/analysis/business-inflection.md`) — material strategic change, evidence tier/date, estimates or multiple channel, priced/unpriced verdict, proof clock, **and an Act-when trigger (proof + level + date → a position or trim)**. If a data source is unavailable, say so—do not silently drop the section.
- **Prove it** — end with a **Sources** section: every material number a dated link. (For an industry/theme run, follow `skills/analysis/industry-map.md`: layer-ranked call + an actionable "want X → buy Y" matrix + theme risks — *and still give each pick the per-stock depth above*.)

## Action — what to do now
> [!VERDICT] **BUY/TRIM <TICKER> — the move and the why in one sentence.**
> [!ACTION] size ($/shares), entry, stop, first target; now or wait for a dip.
> [!NOTE] **Book state:** resting orders (side/symbol/qty/limit, or "none live"); **cash / reserved / net buying power** — reconciled. Flag any resting order that fights the plan as a cancel/replace ticket.
> [!NOTE] **Cash:** deploy vs hold, and any event to keep powder for.
_If nothing clears the bar, say so and recommend holding cash._

- **Insider / smart-money** — dated Form-4 open-market buys/sells (names, shares, prices) or 13F positioning.
#### The setup — levels & signals
![<TICKER> price/volume](charts/<TICKER>-<date>-price.svg) ![<TICKER> signals](charts/<TICKER>-<date>-gauges.svg)
- **S/R ladder (with strength)** — each level + times tested. **Trend/momentum:** SMA20/50/200, RSI, MACD, Stochastic, ADX; **volume:** rel-vol, OBV — cite `indicators.py`.
- **Money-flow:** flow_pressure, coil_energy, divergence, verdict + trigger — cite `flow_anomaly.py`; options overlay (P/C, IV rank, skew) if pulled.

#### Forecast — the odds
- **Structure:** BB-width percentile (coiled?) + support tested ×k. **Monte Carlo (~20d):** P(up)/P(down), expected move, cone p10/median/p90. **First-passage / base rate** + which clock wins — cite `forecast.py` (`--drift` for a headwind). If it isn't coiled, say so.
#### Fundamentals & catalyst
- <valuation vs a mature comparable · roadmap · the narrative gap · dated catalysts>
> [!ACTION] **Trade plan:** entry, stop (ATR/structure + hard invalidation), **3-step target ladder**, shares, $ at risk (% acct), exit.
> [!RISK] **What kills it:** 2–3 invalidation conditions.

## After the report

To act on a recommendation, follow the active mode in `skills/decision/trading-modes.md` and the
ticket mechanics in `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`: restate → preview → apply the mode's
authorization rule → place or leave unplaced. **Default resting limits to the 24-hour market**
(`market_hours=all_day_hours` + `gtc`, whole shares) when eligible—details and caveats are in the
execution skill.

## Reference map

All sub-skills live in `skills/`, grouped by capability — start at **`skills/README.md`** for the annotated map. Groups: **edge/** (variant-perception, thematic-waves, smart-money) · **analysis/** (quant-levels, chip-distribution, money-flow, pattern-forecast, industry-map, business-inflection, value-radar, catalyst-scan, macro-regime, crisis-playbook, sector-playbooks + sectors/ + stocks, plus `skills/analysis/valuation-quality-gate.md`) · **decision/** (roles, research-debate, risk-committee, review-rubric, stress-test, sufficiency-gate, strategies, sell-timing, reflection-memory, weekly-retrospective, tax-aware, `skills/decision/insight-registry.md`, `skills/decision/trading-modes.md`) · **playbook/** (mentor-method, mentor-casebook, house-views, watchlist-theses, options, private-deals — bring-your-own) · **execution/** (data-and-execution). The categorized engine inventory and lifecycle are maintained in `scripts/README.md`.

**Toolkit reliability:** prefer wrapping engine runs — `python3 scripts/lib/desk_log.py run -- python3 scripts/<group>/<engine>.py …` — so every run leaves a debuggable trace (args, duration, exit code, stderr tail) in git-ignored logs; `desk_log.py stats` shows per-script error rates and latency. Key build/method decisions (new gates, data contracts, privacy posture) are recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/` — read them before proposing structural changes, and scaffold a new one with `python3 scripts/ops/new_adr.py "Title"` when you make one.

`scripts/lib/clock.py` records UTC instants and renders labeled Pacific display times; `scripts/lib/test_clock.py` locks that contract across DST.

## Private deals (separate track)

For a startup/venture investment (a private round, pre-IPO SPV), don't force it through the trading pipeline — use `skills/playbook/private-deals.md` for DD and stress-testing, kept separate from the tradable portfolio.
