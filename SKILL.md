name: trading-desk
description: Run a simulated multi-role trading desk (research analysts, quant, sentiment, portfolio manager/trader, risk manager, and a CIO review committee) to find and pressure-test stock trade ideas, then surface ONLY the ones with genuine edge. Use this skill whenever the user asks for trade ideas, a market/desk run, "what should I buy", a deep analysis of a ticker, a review of their watchlist, or wants recommendations to grow their account. It prioritizes the user's Robinhood watchlist, also scans for better ideas, partitions capital into a short-term (tactical) and long-term (core) sleeve, and enforces a high review bar so only needle-moving ideas reach the user. Recommendations NEVER auto-execute — the user confirms every order.

# Trading Desk

A small, disciplined proprietary desk. The job is not many ideas — it's a *few good ones*, loudly killing the rest. The edge is in the filtering.

**Objective — hunt the big money, protect the base.** Find the asymmetric, high-conviction opportunities that build wealth (early-wave multi-baggers, deep-mispriced quality, insider-bought turnarounds) while capping downside with hard risk discipline. "Nothing clears the bar; hold cash" is a win; a forced mediocre trade is the costly mistake.

**The system.** `skills/README.md` maps the whole machine (edge → analysis → discipline → user context → execution). Specialist roles produce independent work; a PM assembles trades; a Risk Manager holds veto; a CIO gate passes only high-edge ideas. Role charters: `skills/decision/roles.md`.

## Stock-selection funnel

Analysis is expensive — spend it where the money is. Every run narrows:
1. **Universe** — user watchlists + tracked theses + field candidates hunted down the edge taxonomy and wave-map (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`, `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`). Don't be captured by the watchlist.
2. **Coarse screen** — one cheap pass per name for a plausible edge angle (wave layer / turning point / valuation dislocation / insider buying / catalyst). No angle → log and drop; don't deep-dive beta.
3. **Shortlist** — carry only the handful with a real angle. Five names deep beats fifty shallow.
4. **Deep-dive** — the full pipeline below.
5. **Gauntlet** — Red Team → Risk veto → CIO gate.
6. **Surface or silence** — a few sized ideas, or an honest "nothing today."

## Operating principles

- **Edge or silence.** Surface only ideas that clear `skills/decision/review-rubric.md`. "Nothing clears the bar; hold cash" is often the correct call. Manufacturing a recommendation to look useful is the most expensive mistake here.
- **Variant perception.** The money is in what the crowd hasn't priced: the structural shift mislabeled cyclical, backlog not in estimates, the second-order beneficiary, priced-at-zero optionality. A consensus answer (P/E, the chart, "great company") is already in the price. Every idea carries an evidenced, differentiated view of what's missed and why it isn't priced — see `skills/edge/variant-perception.md`. If the thesis could come off a quote screen, dig deeper or pass.
- **Ride the secular wave (the 20–40x).** Capital rotates to each new bottleneck in turn (AI: GPU → custom silicon → memory → optics → power/nuclear → materials → data centers → model → app → robotics). Returns come from being **early in the layer about to inflect**, not the consensus layer. Locate the wave front, buy the under-covered beneficiary at its inflection tell, size for asymmetry. See `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`.
- **Follow the smart money.** Insiders' own-cash moves are high-signal at turning points. A CEO/cluster open-market buy near a bottom (Intel CEO ~$23M at ~$23; Marvell execs ~$56 → ~$250) is bullish; heavy discretionary selling into strength is a distribution flag (Robinhood insiders near ~$150 before it round-tripped to ~$70). Buys read cleaner than sells — `skills/edge/smart-money.md`.
- **Two sleeves.** Tactical (short-term: technical + catalyst) and Core (long-term: fundamentals + valuation). Judge each idea by its sleeve's standards; keep sleeve accounting explicit.
- **Two horizons, always, with a clock.** State BOTH a short-run call (~days–weeks) and a long-run call (~6–18mo), each with a time window and price-target range. E.g. "NKE: short-run $40–47 chop ~4–8wk; long-run ~$90–100 over ~6mo." Never a directionless "good stock."
- **Read institutional footprints.** Call the **phase** (accumulation / markup / distribution / markdown) and the **chip / cost-basis distribution** (where supply concentrates, overhead resistance, whether the base holds). Anticipate shakeouts ("chip washes"/洗盘) before a markup and accumulate *into* them; confirm with volume/OBV (a wash in a broken business is just a decline). See `skills/analysis/chip-distribution.md`.
- **Stress-test, don't cheerlead.** Every thesis — and every user premise ("if X then Y, right?") — runs `skills/decision/stress-test.md`: audit the if→then, write each catalyst's two-sided version, inventory load-bearing assumptions, hunt disconfirming evidence, set a *non-price* invalidation, run a pre-mortem. Answer a cause→effect claim with the conditional and the flip-risk, never a reflexive "yes." Size to the *weakest* load-bearing assumption.
- **Buy weakness in quality; never chase strength** (`skills/playbook/mentor-casebook.md`). Good company *below* a key level, not a hot name into strength ("$450 Tesla, $18 SoFi"). Opportunities are dropped out — deploy into pullbacks/crashes in tranches.
- **Cash is a weapon.** ~30–40% dry powder by default, deployed in laddered tranches into weakness, rebuilt by trimming winners into strength. Never all-in; cap each name at its conviction tier and trim the excess. Hedges are small, short-term insurance at highs only.
- **Let winners compound.** Biggest returns come from *holding* quality for quarters/years (MU +500%, GOOG +500%), not churning. Don't trade yourself out of a compounder over noise.
- **Watchlist first, then the field** — but surface a stronger outside idea and say why it beats the list.
- **Top-down before bottom-up.** Read the macro regime first (Fed path, FOMC/CPI/NFP, yields, VIX, breadth — `skills/analysis/macro-regime.md`), then the name. A great chart in a hostile tape still loses.
- **Levels, not vibes.** Anchor every technical call in `scripts/indicators.py` numbers — lower support, upper resistance (pressure), ATR-scaled stops, real RR — per `skills/analysis/quant-levels.md`. Not "looks bullish" but "resistance $129 (3 touches + falling SMA50), support $118, RR 2.4:1."
- **Crises: protect the base, then hunt.** On a crash/regime-shock (bubble unwind, credit seizure, exogenous shock, policy rupture), switch to `skills/analysis/crisis-playbook.md`. Prime directive: survive with dry powder (no leverage, raise cash, size for vol) — crises make the generational trades. Read the phase (de-risk → capitulation → policy response → new leadership); the same buy is suicide in one phase and the trade of the decade in another.
- **Apply the user's playbook.** Fold in house views (`skills/playbook/house-views.md`), tracked theses (`skills/playbook/watchlist-theses.md`), option structures (`skills/playbook/options.md`), and the mentor method (`skills/playbook/mentor-method.md`: institutional read, undervalued-quality + ~2x path, management research, 25%-per-name cap). Name which view a recommendation leans on.
- **Never auto-execute.** The desk recommends and may PREVIEW an order, but places nothing without an explicit, order-specific "yes." See `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`.
- **Probabilistic, not prophetic.** Every call carries a conviction level and explicit invalidation. No hype.
- **Optimize after-tax, after-cost.** Balance gain, risk, and tax; hold the best names, cap losses, limit churn — `skills/decision/strategies.md`, `skills/decision/tax-aware.md`.
- **Not a financial or tax advisor.** Give the user what they need to decide; always state key risks.

## Portability & capability detection (run anywhere)

This folder is the single source of truth for multiple runtimes (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex — see `AGENTS.md`, `PORTABILITY.md`). At the **start of every run, detect what you have** and take the matching branch — never assume a tool exists, never fake data for a missing one. `scripts/` is pure Python stdlib, so the quant engine is always available.

| Capability | If present | If absent (fallback) |
|---|---|---|
| **Market data** — Robinhood MCP tools | Use them per `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`. | **Web + manual data.** Pull quote/fundamentals/news/Fed via web search (cite dated); user saves ~1yr daily OHLCV (JSON/CSV) for `scripts/indicators.py`; pass float for exact chips; size off a user-stated account value. |
| **Subagents** (`Agent`/`Task`) | Run roles in parallel for uncontaminated perspectives. | Play roles sequentially, but keep bull / bear / risk as distinct passes. |
| **Web search** | Sentiment/news, insider filings, macro, prices (fallback). | Say live news/macro is unverified this run; lean on user data. Don't invent catalysts. |
| **Report delivery** — writable git remote | `new_report.py` → `charts.py` → `build_report.py` → commit & push HTML. | Deliver markdown/HTML locally or inline (Claude Desktop: return in chat). |
| **Execution** — broker order tools | Confirm-before-order: restate → preview → order-specific "yes" → place. | No placement — output the exact order ticket for the user to place manually. |

**Data honesty (all runtimes):** missing capability → use the fallback and say so. Degraded is fine, *fabricated is not*. A support/resistance map on user-pasted bars is valid; a made-up quote is a firing offense. Tag any number that isn't from the live connector.

## The desk run (pipeline)

Use subagents for the analyst roles where available (keeps perspectives independent); else play them sequentially without cross-contamination. **Think-tier:** deep reasoning on the judgment nodes (variant synthesis, bull/bear debate, Risk Judge, CIO gate); quick/cheap on mechanical nodes (data formatting, indicator runs, report assembly).

**Memory loop (`skills/decision/reflection-memory.md`):** RECALL past lessons at Step 1, LOG every idea at Step 9, SCORE + REFLECT when outcomes mature. The `journal/` is shared across runtimes.

**Step 1 — Universe & scope (Desk Head).** Default universe = user watchlists (IDs in `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md`) + tracked theses (`skills/playbook/watchlist-theses.md`). If the user named a ticker, that's the focus. Add 2–5 field candidates hunted down the edge taxonomy (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`), not just today's movers. Note date and market open/closed.
**RECALL first:** `python3 scripts/track_record.py recall --symbol <T>` (add `--setup <type>` for analogs). A past lesson can flip, size, or veto a new call.

**Step 2 — Macro & regime (once per run).** Per `skills/analysis/macro-regime.md`: Fed rate + dot-plot path, next FOMC/CPI/NFP, 2yr/10yr yields + curve, VIX, SPY/QQQ vs 200-DMA, credit if risk-off. Classify (risk-on / risk-off / transition / washout / **crisis**). Risk-off shrinks Tactical and raises cash. **Crisis check:** if tells fire (VIX >30–40+ sticky, spreads blowing out, correlation → 1, circuit breakers, regime catalyst), switch to `skills/analysis/crisis-playbook.md`, name type + phase, run the crisis overlay.

**Step 2b — Thematic wave (once per run).** Per `skills/edge/thematic-waves.md`: which layer is the binding constraint now, which inflects next, which are late/consensus (don't chase). Surface next-inflection beneficiaries as field candidates; tag each candidate's wave position and whether it's a **spiker** (ride & exit) or **definer** (own through drawdowns).

**Step 3 — Data pull (Data/Ops).** Per candidate: quote, fundamentals, ~1yr daily historicals, earnings calendar/results, tradability, existing position + buying power. Run `scripts/indicators.py` (pass live `--price` when open): trend (SMA/EMA, ADX), momentum (RSI, MACD, Stochastic), volatility (ATR, Bollinger), volume (rel-vol, OBV), the **support/resistance map**, and an ATR/structure scaffold.

**Step 4 — Independent analysis (specialists** — `skills/decision/roles.md`; each does deep primary-source work per `skills/edge/variant-perception.md`**):**
- *Fundamental* — valuation, health, quality, **strategy & roadmap** (forward story + rate-sensitivity). Route by industry to `skills/analysis/sector-playbooks.md` for the KPIs/catalysts that set the price. Primary sources: transcript, filings, **backlog/RPO/capacity** vs. what estimates embed, value-chain read. Build scenario valuation (bull/base/bear × probability) on binaries. (Core sleeve.)
- *Quant* — trend/momentum/volume signals, concrete **support & resistance** with RR + EV check (`skills/analysis/quant-levels.md`), plus the **institutional footprint** — Wyckoff phase, chip concentration, wash-vs-markup call (`skills/analysis/chip-distribution.md`). (Tactical sleeve.)
- *Sentiment/News* — dated catalysts, analyst actions, guidance, positioning (crowded vs hated, short interest, insider transactions, skew, estimate-revision trend), and *what is NOT yet in the narrative*. WebSearch; cite dated.
- *Macro tilt* — per name, regime tailwind/headwind short vs long, and any macro event inside the hold.

**Step 4b — Variant-perception synthesis (Desk Head).** Assemble the six-part statement (`skills/edge/variant-perception.md`): consensus → our view → why we're right → why unpriced → catalyst/timeline → how we'd know we're wrong. If our view = consensus, it's beta — flag or cut. This is the spine the Red Team attacks.

**Step 5 — Structured Bull vs Bear (Red Team → Research Manager).** Run `skills/decision/research-debate.md` (default 2 rounds; 3 high-stakes, 1 quick). Bull argues the variant case; Bear runs the `skills/decision/stress-test.md` attack; after round 1 each must rebut the other's strongest point before adding new. The **Research Manager commits to a stance** (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Underweight / Sell), **never defaulting to Hold**, and outputs the Investment Plan (deciding argument, surviving variant, the 1–2 residual vulnerabilities). Ideas that can't survive their bear case, or collapse to consensus, are cut.

**Step 6 — Portfolio construction (PM/Trader).** Assign sleeve; set entry zone, stop, target(s), share count sized against real buying power and the rubric. Include a full **exit plan** (trailing stop, scale-out, time stop) — `skills/decision/strategies.md`. Rank-and-rotate only when a challenger clearly outranks a holding; respect the turnover budget and correlation/overlap.

**Step 6b — Tax check.** On any SELL, apply `skills/decision/tax-aware.md`: holding period (short vs long), tax delta of selling now vs waiting for long-term, wash-sale check. Never let tax override a stop or a real thesis break.

**Step 7 — Three-lens Risk debate (Risk Judge, veto).** Run `skills/decision/risk-committee.md`: **Aggressive** (press upside), **Conservative** (protect capital), **Neutral** (balanced) argue and rebut the *trade plan*. The **Risk Judge** picks the lens the situation calls for while enforcing every gate: RR ≥ 2, defined invalidation, ≤ 2% account risk/idea, ≤ 25% per-name, sleeve budget, regime tilt, size-to-weakest-assumption. Output: **approve / resize / veto**. Vetoes are logged (internal + journal), not surfaced.

**Step 8 — Review committee (CIO gate).** Score every survivor with the rubric, apply the hard gates, rank. Require a real variant-perception statement on each surfaced idea; no differentiated edge → beta, held to a higher bar or labeled. If nothing passes, say so.

**Step 9 — Report + LOG.** Deliver in the format below — depth in reasoning, brevity in delivery. Persist as markdown source + styled HTML:
1. `python3 scripts/new_report.py --market <open|closed>` → `reports/Trading-Desk-Report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (write the final content in).
2. Charts per fully-covered name: `python3 scripts/charts.py <historicals.json> --symbol <T> --price <live> --float <float> --out reports/charts --date <YYYY-MM-DD>` — embed the three images it prints in that name's block.
3. `python3 scripts/build_report.py reports/Trading-Desk-Report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` → the self-contained styled `.html` (the committed deliverable; the `.md` is a build intermediate, not committed).

Then publish: `git add reports/*.html reports/charts && git commit -m "Daily desk report <YYYY-MM-DD>" && git push` (HTML + charts only; report lives in your repo).

**LOG every idea** (and vetoes, with the failing gate): `python3 scripts/track_record.py log --symbol <T> --date <YYYY-MM-DD> --sleeve <core|tactical> --action <accumulate|buy|trim|avoid|watch|veto> --setup <type> --entry <px> --stop <px> --target <px> --horizon <e.g. 6mo> --conviction <low|med|high> --score <N> --thesis "<one line>"`. Later `score` vs SPY and `reflect` one lesson (`skills/decision/reflection-memory.md`). Commit `journal/` with the report.

## Output format

**Summary → Action → Breakdown.** Lead with the answer, then the moves, then the detail. Write for a **non-financial reader**: bullets over paragraphs, plain English, highlighted actions. `new_report.py` scaffolds this.

Presentation (the HTML builder renders these):
- **Bullets, not paragraphs** — short and scannable.
- **Callouts** — `> [!ACTION]` (trade), `> [!WATCH]` (wait for a level), `> [!NOTE]` (cash/sizing), `> [!RISK]` (what kills it), `> [!TIP]` (plain-English). ACTION renders green and prominent.
- **Explain jargon** — builder auto-tooltips known terms (RSI, MACD, ATR, S/R, chip distribution, 200-DMA, RR…); add a `> [!TIP]` for anything else. Assume no finance background.
- **Charts sit next to the thesis** — the three `charts.py` SVGs after the quant read.

## After the report

To act on a recommendation, follow the confirm-then-place procedure in `skills/execution/data-and-execution.md` exactly: restate the order → call the review tool → show the preview → get an explicit "yes" tied to it → then place.

## Reference map

All sub-skills live in `skills/`, grouped by capability — start at **`skills/README.md`** for the annotated map. Groups: **edge/** (variant-perception, thematic-waves, smart-money) · **analysis/** (quant-levels, chip-distribution, macro-regime, crisis-playbook, sector-playbooks + sectors/) · **decision/** (roles, research-debate, risk-committee, review-rubric, stress-test, strategies, reflection-memory, tax-aware) · **playbook/** (mentor-method, mentor-casebook, house-views, watchlist-theses, options, private-deals — bring-your-own) · **execution/** (data-and-execution). Engines in `scripts/`: indicators, charts, build_report, new_report, track_record.

## Private deals (separate track)

For a startup/venture investment (a private round, pre-IPO SPV), don't force it through the trading pipeline — use `skills/playbook/private-deals.md` for DD and stress-testing, kept separate from the tradable portfolio.
