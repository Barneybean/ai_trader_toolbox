## 🧭 Overview

Most "AI stock picker" projects optimize for *more* signals. A real trading desk makes money by
being **selective** and **managing risk**. AI Trader encodes that discipline as a pipeline of
independent roles that argue, stress-test, and vote — and that mostly answers *"nothing clears the
bar today."*

It is **agent-driven**: the intelligence lives in prompt/skill files an AI coding agent reads
([`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) + [`skills/`](skills/)), backed by pure-Python engines for the
deterministic math. Run it under whatever model and coding agent you like — **no LLM API key required**
for the default mode (you do need a broker connection for market data — see below).

> 🌱 **This is the open-source starter.** It ships **general trading knowledge and one example
> skill** — no personal positions, no proprietary edge. **Fork it and make it yours:** plug in your
> own watchlist, house views, mentor method, and broker. Your customizations live in git-ignored
> overlays, so a private, personalized desk sits on top of a public base.

**What makes it different**

- **Bring your own edge.** The framework supplies the *process*; you supply the *variant perception*.
  Consensus ideas ("great company, cheap P/E") are filtered out by design.
- **Structured disagreement.** A multi-round bull/bear debate and a three-lens risk committee mean
  no thesis wins by assertion. *(Architecture inspired by [TradingAgents](#-acknowledgements--citation).)*
- **It learns.** Every call is journaled, scored against SPY (alpha, not just raw), and distilled to
  one reusable lesson that's recalled on the next similar setup.
- **Privacy by construction.** A PII gate blocks account numbers, keys, and personal data from ever
  reaching a public branch.

## 🏛️ The Desk

A multi-agent system that mirrors a real trading firm: specialists produce independent work, a
research committee debates it, a risk committee sizes it, and a CIO gate lets only high-edge ideas
through.

### 👥 Analyst Team
Four independent lenses, each doing primary-source work (details in [`skills/decision/roles.md`](skills/decision/roles.md)):
- **Fundamental** — business quality, valuation, strategy & product pipeline, management read, scenario targets.
- **Quant** — trend/momentum/volume, the **support & resistance ("pressure") map**, ATR-scaled RR, and the **chip / cost-basis distribution** + Wyckoff phase.
- **Sentiment / News** — dated catalysts, positioning, insider flows, and *what isn't in the narrative yet*.
- **Macro / Regime** — Fed path, yields, VIX, breadth; a crisis playbook when the tape breaks.

### ⚔️ Research Debate  *(bull vs bear → Research Manager)*
A **multi-round** debate ([`skills/decision/research-debate.md`](skills/decision/research-debate.md)): the bull argues the variant thesis, the bear runs the stress-test as live ammunition, each must rebut the other's strongest point — then a Research Manager **commits to a stance** (Strong Buy … Sell) and never defaults to "Hold."

### 🛡️ Risk Committee  *(three lenses → Risk Judge)*
Aggressive, Neutral, and Conservative lenses debate the *trade plan* ([`skills/decision/risk-committee.md`](skills/decision/risk-committee.md)); the Risk Judge adjudicates to **approve / resize / veto**, enforcing hard gates (RR ≥ 2, ≤ 2% risk/idea, ≤ 25% per-name, regime tilt).

### 🧠 Reflection & Memory  *(the desk learns)*
Every call is logged; when it matures it's scored **raw + alpha vs SPY** and distilled to one reusable lesson, recalled on the next similar setup ([`skills/decision/reflection-memory.md`](skills/decision/reflection-memory.md)). *(Inspired by TradingAgents' reflection loop.)*

## 📄 Sample report

See what a run produces: **[`reports/sample-report.html`](reports/sample-report.html)** — a real desk
run (sanitized), one self-contained HTML file with charts inlined. Open it in a browser, or view it
rendered without cloning via a raw-HTML previewer (e.g. prepend
`https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the file's GitHub URL once your repo is public).

That sample (a July 2026 run over **INTC · MRVL · NKE · SOFI · KMX**) shows the format:

- **Summary → Action → Breakdown**, written for a non-finance reader.
- Colour-coded **callouts** — green ACTION (the trade), amber WATCH (wait-for-a-level), RISK (what kills it), NOTE (cash/sizing).
- Per-name **charts** — price/volume with the support/resistance ladder, the **chip-distribution** histogram (profit vs. trapped supply), and RSI/Stochastic/ADX gauges.
- The **quant read** (support/resistance, trend, momentum, volume), the **variant-perception** edge, **short- vs long-run** calls, a sized **trade plan** (entry / stop / target / % risk), and cash management around the CPI date.
- The **discipline**: what to buy, what to *wait* for, and where it holds cash instead of forcing a trade.

> Illustrative only — a demo of the output format, not investment advice.

## ⚡ Quickstart

> 🤖 **Easiest path: hand this README to your AI agent.** Share this file (and [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md))
> with your CLI agent — Claude Code or Codex — and say *"read this and set it up, then run a desk
> run for me."* The whole toolkit is designed to be **operated by an agent reading these docs**: it
> can install the PII gate, wire your config, connect the broker, and drive the desk end-to-end.
> The steps below are the same thing done by hand.

### Agent-driven (the default — no API key)

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> ai-trader && cd ai-trader
cp config.example.toml config.local.toml   # add your broker/account (git-ignored)
cp .env.example .env                        # only if you use an API-key feature
bash scripts/install_hooks.sh                 # install the PII gate (recommended)
```

Then point your agent at the skill and ask for a run:

- **Claude Code** — the repo's [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) *is* the skill.
- **Codex / any AGENTS.md agent** — [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) routes it in.
- See [`PORTABILITY.md`](PORTABILITY.md) to wire every runtime to one source folder.

> 💡 **Use a CLI agent (Claude Code or Codex), not a desktop app.** Desktop apps run in a
> restricted sandbox that limits broker connectors, shell/script execution, and order placement — so
> the agentic-trading loop often **won't work** there. The CLI can run the engines, hold the broker
> connection, and place confirmed orders end-to-end. Run the desk from a terminal.

> *"Do a desk run on NVDA."*  ·  *"Review my watchlist."*  ·  *"Short- and long-run call on INTC?"*

The desk pulls data, runs the pipeline, and returns a ranked, risk-checked report — or an honest
"nothing clears the bar." If no broker connector is present, it falls back to web data + a
historicals JSON you supply (see *Portability & capability detection* in `SKILL.md`).

### Use the engines standalone (no agent)

```bash
# Indicators + S/R map + chip distribution:
python3 scripts/indicators.py path/to/historicals.json --price 128.40 --float 4100000000

# The learning journal:
python3 scripts/track_record.py recall --symbol NVDA
python3 scripts/track_record.py report            # win rate + avg alpha + recent lessons
```

Pure Python standard library — no dependencies, runs anywhere `python3` does.

## 🧩 Make It Yours

The repo ships **generic starter templates** — replace them with your own edge:

| File | Put here |
|---|---|
| `skills/playbook/house-views.md` | Your macro/technical heuristics |
| `skills/playbook/watchlist-theses.md` | Names you track + thesis + invalidation |
| `skills/playbook/mentor-method.md` · `skills/playbook/mentor-casebook.md` | The method/investor you study |
| `skills/analysis/sectors/` | Add a sector playbook via `sectors/_TEMPLATE.md` |

**Keep private content private.** Anything under `skills/private/` is **git-ignored** — put a
confidential watchlist, a paid newsletter's live book, or a private deal there and it never lands in
your fork's public history.

---

## 🔌 Broker Support

**A connected broker is required.** At least one **Robinhood agentic account** (or an equivalent
connector with the same data + agentic functions) must be linked — the desk pulls quotes,
historicals, fundamentals, positions, and buying power through it, and that data drives most of the
research. The web + manual-data fallback works without one but is materially more limited.

| Broker | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Robinhood** | ✅ working (via connector) | Quotes, historicals, fundamentals, positions, confirm-before-order execution. |
| **Interactive Brokers** | 🔌 planned | Adapter interface + config slot ship now; implementation welcome. |
| **Futu / moomoo** | 🔌 planned | Same. |

### Robinhood: connect your AI agent (agentic trading)

Robinhood exposes an **agentic trading** connector that lets an AI agent read your data and place
orders (with confirmation). Follow Robinhood's official setup:

➡️ **[Robinhood — Agentic Trading Overview → *Connect your AI agent*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/agentic-trading-overview/#ConnectyourAIagent)**

> 💡 **Do this from a CLI agent (Claude Code or Codex), not a desktop app.** The desktop sandbox
> commonly blocks the connector and order placement, so agentic trading may not work there at all.
> Enable the connector, then put the account you authorize into `config.local.toml` (git-ignored).
> The desk still **confirms every order with you before placing it.**

The design goal is **one broker-adapter interface** — add a broker by implementing a single class.

## 🔒 Privacy & the PII Gate

Publishing trading tooling means **never leaking your account or positions.** This repo enforces it:

- **Secrets live only in git-ignored files** — `config.local.toml`, `.env`, `skills/private/`.
- **A scanner** — [`scripts/scan_pii.py`](scripts/scan_pii.py) — flags account numbers, keys, connector
  UUIDs, and personal identifiers in tracked files.
- **A three-layer gate** blocks PII from reaching the public branch:
  1. **pre-commit** hook — refuses to stage PII on a public branch,
  2. **pre-push** hook — refuses to push it,
  3. **CI** ([`.github/workflows/pii-scan.yml`](.github/workflows/pii-scan.yml)) — the server-side
     backstop that can't be skipped.

```bash
bash scripts/install_hooks.sh          # turn on the local gate
python3 scripts/scan_pii.py            # scan on demand before publishing
```

Add your exact private strings to `scripts/pii_denylist.local.txt` (git-ignored) for hard blocking.
