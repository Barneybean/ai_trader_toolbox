# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Key decisions about **how this desk works** — method, pipeline, toolkit architecture, data
contracts, privacy posture, runtime/broker support — get recorded here as short, numbered,
immutable documents. The reports capture what the desk *concluded*; ADRs capture why the
machine is *built the way it is*, so an iteration six months from now doesn't re-litigate
(or silently undo) a decision whose rationale lived only in a chat session.

## When to write one

Write an ADR when a change:

- alters the **desk method** (a new gate, a changed funnel step, a scoring change),
- changes **toolkit architecture** or a **data contract** (storage formats, journal schemas,
  what a script consumes/emits),
- changes the **privacy posture** (what may be logged, committed, or published),
- adds/drops a **runtime or broker** integration,
- rejects a significant alternative someone is likely to propose again.

Routine bug fixes, copy edits, and new reference content don't need one.

## Process

1. Scaffold: `python3 scripts/ops/new_adr.py "Short decision title"` → creates the next
   `NNNN-slug.md` from [`template.md`](template.md) with status **Proposed**.
2. Fill in Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives. Keep it under a page.
3. Land it in the same commit/PR as the change it explains. Flip status to **Accepted** when
   the change ships.
4. Never rewrite an accepted ADR's decision. To change course, write a new ADR and mark the
   old one **Superseded by ADR-NNNN**. Numbers are never reused.
5. This directory is public — the PII gate applies. No account data, no personal identifiers;
   run `python3 scripts/ops/scan_pii.py` before pushing, like everything else.

`python3 scripts/ops/new_adr.py --list` prints the index (number, status, title).
