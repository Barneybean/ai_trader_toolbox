# User Manual

How to drive the desk from your phone or a terminal. The methodology itself lives in
`SKILL.md` and `skills/`.

## Daily-report promise

You do not need to say “complete” to get complete work. “Run a daily report,” “run a full daily
report,” and “run a complete daily report” all invoke the maximum decision-grade pipeline: recall
history first, gather enough fresh dated evidence, run the relevant roles and engines, debate the
thesis, apply the risk and sufficiency gates, and return the full human-reviewable report.

Use “quick update,” “changes only,” or “status only” only when you want monitoring rather than a
report. If a quick check surfaces a possible action, the desk should escalate to the full analysis
before recommending anything.

## Talking to the desk

**Terminal:** run your coding agent in the repo and ask for a report, analysis, or review in plain
language.

**Phone:** use the optional bridge in `docs/phone-connection.md` if you want the same interaction
from a messaging app.

Examples:

- `Run a daily report on NVDA.`
- `Run a complete report on AI robotics opportunities.`
- `Analyze META.`
- `What changed since the last run?`

## Modes and commands

The public docs expose the same command surface as the phone bridge.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Show bridge health, active agent, mode, and session state. |
| `/agent` | Open a numbered picker of configured agent/model pairs — up to four models each with passive availability; every pair has its own number. |
| `/agent N` (or a bare `N` within five minutes) | Select that exact default agent and model for future runs. |
| `/agent codex` · `/agent claude` | Open that agent's focused model picker. Manual selection changes future runs only — it does not interrupt the active turn or disable automatic availability switching. |
| `/new` | Start fresh sessions and clear old conversation state. |
| `/mode` | Show the current trading mode. |
| `/mode manual` | Require explicit confirmation for each order. |
| `/mode semi` | Propose numbered tickets and wait for approval. |
| `/mode full` | Allow the opt-in autonomous mode, still bound by the desk gates. |
| `/stop` | Interrupt the active turn but keep its session and any completed file. |
| `/steer TEXT` | Redirect the currently running turn without starting over. |
| `/decide N` | Answer a pending agent decision by number and resume that session. |
| `/help` | List the supported commands. |

## Reports and recovery

The phone bridge automatically sends each new, complete HTML report once; the agent does not need
to remember a `FILE:` marker. A rerun preserves the earlier report and creates a distinct artifact.
Only an explicit request to revise a named report updates an existing one; the desk asks when the
target is ambiguous.

If report generation alone reaches its tool budget, the bridge can make one smaller fresh-session
completion attempt. That attempt cannot place, cancel, or replace orders, and incomplete report
scaffolds are never delivered. Execution transcripts stay in local ignored logs unless you opt in to
phone delivery. In semi mode, saved report tickets are followed by a compact numbered action list and
the exact `approve N` / `approve all` instruction.

## Safety rules

- Never publish secrets, account identifiers, or live session IDs.
- Keep the bridge and agent order configurable.
- Use the public boundary standard in `docs/open-source-boundary.md` when deciding what belongs in
  the reusable core.
- A significant docs or behavior change should run `python3 scripts/ops/smoke_test.py` and the normal
  consistency / PII checks before you ship it.
